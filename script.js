//WHAT DOES THIS PROJECT ENTAIL EXACTLY?
//Simple game with five horses racing. The player begins with $1,000 and is betting with 50 other people on which horse they think will win. They all have to enter the same amount and the pool is split evenly.
//During each course, there are 10 rounds, and in each course a single random horse has a slight advantage for all 10 rounds.
